# DAGSFYLLA.NO - YOUR NEW EVENT PLANNER

### This is the source code repository of dagsfylla.no

Dagsfylla.no is the new service for planning social events like daydrunks and evening drunks.

### Warning
This project is currently under heavy development, and we're hoping to have version 1.0 of the solution out as soon as possible. The project is completely open source, and all help, feeback and critizism is very much welcome. Please file an issue if there's something you would like to see, doesn't work, or otherwise.

### Technology platform

#### Frontend
We use React.js as the frontend framework, and use Grommet as our style-framework, and styled-components for custom styles.

#### Backend
We are fully serverless and utilize AWS Lambda-functions written in javascript in the backend.

#### Database
We also use a serverless database called Faunadb. It combines schemafree indexes with ACID-compliant transactions and relational concepts.
